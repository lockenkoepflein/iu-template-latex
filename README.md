# IU LaTeX Clean Template (Overleaf-ready)

This repository provides a minimalistic LaTeX template for academic papers at [IU International University](https://www.iu.de/), such as essays, term papers, or advanced workbooks.  
The template is optimized for easy use in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

## Origin
This template is based on the project [markushaug/iu-latex-template](https://github.com/markushaug/iu-latex-template), but has been heavily reduced and adapted by me (@lockenkoepflein).

## What's different?
- Simplified template.
- Cleaned and flat project structure.
- Removed all developer tools like Docker and VS Code settings.
- Fully compatible with LuaHBTeX (recommended by IU – can be set in Overleaf).

## Usage in Overleaf
1. Download the repository as ZIP:
   - Click **Code → Download ZIP**.
2. Extract the ZIP archive locally.
3. Upload all files to a new project in [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).
4. In Overleaf → **Settings → Compiler: select LuaLaTeX**.
5. Compile the document (`template.tex`).

Optional:  
If you want to use a bibliography (`references.bib`):
- Make sure to select **Biber** as backend in Overleaf settings.
- Then simply **Recompile** (Overleaf will handle everything automatically).
